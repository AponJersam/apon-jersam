            <p class="fst-italic py-3">
              He's name is Apon Jersam, and he is 19-year-old criminology student, currently pursuing her academic dreams with a focus on understanding the complexities of criminal justice. He was born and raised in a loving and supportive family, where he is the second eldest among five siblings. He have three sisters and two brothers, all of whom play an important role in shaping who he is today. Her parents have always encouraged her to strive for success, but more importantly, they instilled in her the values of hard work, honesty, and compassion. Growing up in a close-knit family has been both a blessing and a challenge. As one of the older children, He was given responsibilities early on, helping to care for her younger siblings and being a role model for them. These experiences taught her how to be patient, responsible, and understanding, qualities that have become integral to her character. While there were occasional sibling squabbles, our bond has always been strong, and we support each other in every possible way. From a young age, He developed a keen interest in understanding human behavior and the reasons behind why people commit crimes. This curiosity led her to pursue criminology as a career path. He is always found it fascinating to study the intricate relationships between society, the law, and individuals who deviate from societal norms. He believe that understanding the psychological, social, and environmental factors that contribute to criminal behavior can play a crucial role in preventing crime and reforming the justice system. In high school, He was known as the quiet, observant student who always asked thought-provoking questions. He didn’t always excel in the traditional sense—like in mathematics or science—but he found her strengths in subjects like history, psychology, and social studies. These subjects piqued her interest in criminal justice and led her to choose criminology as her major in college. Here decision was not an easy one, as many of her peers had other career aspirations, but he felt a deep sense of purpose in studying the law and its effects on society. During her first year of college, he have learned a great deal about criminal behavior, law enforcement, and the justice system. Though challenging, the experience has only deepened her passion for criminology. He hope to use her education to contribute positively to the field, whether it’s through law enforcement, criminal profiling, or rehabilitation programs. Her ultimate goal is to help bridge the gap between the legal system and the communities it serves, ensuring that justice is both fair and accessible for all. Outside of her studies, He enjoy spending time with her family, as they provide her with emotional support and keep me grounded. He also enjoy reading, particularly books related to psychology and criminology, and occasionally engage in sports for recreation. These activities help her maintain balance in her life and relieve the stress that sometimes comes with being a college student. Looking ahead, He is excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead in her academic and professional journey. He is determined to continue learning, growing, and ultimately making a meaningful contribution to the world of criminology. Through hard work and perseverance, He hope to achieve her dreams and make his family proud. .

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or permission, presenting it as one's own. This can include copying text, images, or data, as well as paraphrasing someone’s ideas without giving credit. Plagiarism is considered unethical and dishonest in academic, professional, and creative contexts. It can apply to a wide range of materials, including written content, scientific research, art, music, and even software code. The key element of plagiarism is the lack of proper citation or attribution, leading to a misrepresentation of authorship.</p>

              <h4></h4>
              <p><em>Plagiarism carries significant consequences in both academic and professional settings. In academics, it can result in severe penalties, including failing grades, suspension, or even expulsion from an institution, as it violates ethical standards and undermines the integrity of education. Professionally, plagiarism damages an individual’s reputation, leading to job termination or legal consequences if copyrighted materials are involved. It also erodes trust and credibility, which can hinder career advancement or future opportunities. Beyond external repercussions, plagiarism stifles personal growth by preventing individuals from developing original thinking and problem-solving skills. Overall, the act of plagiarism has far-reaching impacts that can affect one's education, career, and personal development./em></p>

              <h5></h5>
              <p><em>Avoiding plagiarism requires diligence, proper research practices, and a commitment to academic and professional integrity. Always credit the original authors when using their ideas, words, or data by providing accurate citations and references in the required format. Paraphrase effectively by rewriting the information in your own words while still acknowledging the source. Use plagiarism detection tools to ensure your work is free from unintentional similarities. Plan your work well to avoid the temptation of copying due to time constraints or pressure. Most importantly, focus on understanding and synthesizing the material rather than copying it, fostering originality and critical thinking in your work.</em></p>

                <li>Plagiarism can take various forms, each with distinct characteristics. Direct plagiarism occurs when someone copies another’s work word-for-word without giving credit. Self-plagiarism involves reusing one’s previous work without proper acknowledgment, which is common in academic or professional settings. Mosaic plagiarism, also known as patchwriting, involves blending phrases or ideas from multiple sources without proper citation, often interspersed with original content. Accidental plagiarism happens when a person fails to cite sources correctly or paraphrases poorly, even without the intent to plagiarize. Source-based plagiarism includes misrepresenting sources, such as citing incorrect or nonexistent references, or failing to credit secondary sources properly. Recognizing these types is essential for maintaining ethical standards in any field.</li>

        <p>All about Virus Malware and Anti-Virus</p>
        <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software designed to infect and damage a computer system. It attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when those files are executed or transferred. Once activated, a computer virus can perform harmful actions such as corrupting or deleting files, stealing sensitive information, or slowing down system performance. Some viruses replicate themselves, spreading across networks and infecting other devices. Unlike other types of malware, a virus requires a host file to function, and its primary goal is often to reproduce and spread, making it more difficult to detect and remove without proper antivirus software.</p>
      <div>
        <div>

        </div>

        <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise the functionality of a computer system or network. It can come in various forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal personal information, damage files, disrupt operations, or give unauthorized access to attackers. It often spreads through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software. Protecting against malware involves using antivirus software, regularly updating systems, and practicing safe online habits such as avoiding suspicious links or downloads.</p>
      <div>

      </div>
      <p>An antivirus is a software program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware), including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and other harmful programs from a computer or network. Antivirus programs work by scanning files, programs, and system activities for patterns or behaviors associated with known malware. They often provide real-time protection by continuously monitoring for threats, blocking suspicious activities, and alerting users to potential risks. Additionally, antivirus software is regularly updated to recognize new threats and ensure the system remains protected against emerging malware. It is an essential tool for maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems.</p>
